# Metagenome read mapping approaches

The goal of this repository is to write workflow components for mapping metagenomics reads that can be used on different architectures. 

Data has been simulated using this tool https://github.com/eseiler/raptor_data_simulation

To run the snakemake workflow:
`snakemake --use-conda --cores {e.g 8} --allow-ambiguity`
